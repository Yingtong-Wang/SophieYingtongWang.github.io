	abstract = {Due to the increasing number of serious gun violence in the United States and the growing frequency of gun violence incidents, it is necessary to put ahead significant options and opinions for this problem to interpret applicable data to locate positive rules. In this paper, a study was conducted to discover the relationship between gun violence incidents from economy-related factors. This paper introduces population as an intermediate variable to show their connection. For this purpose, ten data units were set up, and all the unique data units were transformed into {MS} Excel form for classification and sorting to standardize and unify the data by way of states’ names or years. After that, this study carried out a correlation analysis for ten data features to measure the strength of the relationship between variables and calculate the strength of the relationship. After subcategories of gun violence have been recognized and their correlation has been separately demonstrated, the data can be sorted into a single spreadsheet to test whether the individual feature have a relationship throughout time or state. The analysis outcomes indicate a correlation between economic factors and gun violence, and the extra unstable the regional economic situation, the greater the incidence of gun violence.},

	abstract = {The stock market prediction has been an active research area in finance and economics for decades. In recent years, mathematical models have often been used by various experts and scholars for stock market forecasting because of their ability to take into account complex relationships and patterns in the data. This paper summarizes several common mathematical models for stock market prediction, including the Exponential Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity - Mixed Data Sampling Model ({EGARCH}-{MIDAS}), The Local Linearization Method Model ({LMM}), and The Geometric Brownian Motion Model ({GBM}). This paper will discuss the theoretical basis, modeling methods, advantages, and limitations of each model, as well as their application scope and evaluation analysis.},
